## Overview

The Moledcule firmware is responsible for controlling the hardware components and facilitating communication between the device and the Moledcule ecosystem. This includes handling sensor data, managing power consumption, and ensuring reliable operation of the device.

## Features

- Sensor data acquisition and processing
- Power management
- Communication with Moledcule ecosystem
- Over-the-air (OTA) updates
- Error handling and logging

## Requirements

- Supported hardware platform (e.g., specific microcontroller or development board)
- Development environment set up (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO)
- Required libraries and dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/moledcule/moledcule-firmware.git
   cd moledcule-firmware
   \`\`\`

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   platformio lib install
   \`\`\`

3. Build the firmware:

   \`\`\`bash
   platformio run
   \`\`\`

4. Upload the firmware to the hardware:
